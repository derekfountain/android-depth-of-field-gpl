# Introduction #

Thank you for your interest in my project.

This project is an open source, and free software, implementation of a depth of field calculator for photographers. There are dozens of these on the web, and several for Android, so what makes mine special?

  * It's free software - there aren't many of those about
  * It's designed from a usability perspective
    * Sliders for input
    * Multiple tabs for multiple bodies
    * Constantly updating screen
  * It's mine. :)

It looks like this:

There are more screenshots at my personal site [here](http://www.derekfountain.org/software_dofc.php) and the status and current build information is [here](Status.md).

There's some usage guidance [here](Usage.md).
