= Introduction =

Thank you for your interest in my project.

This project is an open source, and free software, implementation of a depth of field calculator for photographers. There are dozens of these on the web, and several for Android, so what makes mine special?

 * It's free software - there aren't many of those about
 * It's designed from a usability perspective
  ** Sliders for input
  ** Multiple tabs for multiple bodies
  ** Constantly updating screen
 * It's mine. :)

It looks like this:
