= Introduction =

Thank you for your interest in my project.

This project is an open source, and free software, implementation of a depth of field calculator for photographers. There are dozens of these on the web, and several for Android, so what makes mine special?

 * It's free software - there aren't many of those about
 * It's designed from a usability perspective
 * It's mine. :)

I haven't actually uploaded the code as yet. This is my first Google Code project and I'm just getting a handle on the facilities and features available.
