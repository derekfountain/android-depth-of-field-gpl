= Bodies =

There are far too many bodies out there to make a list of them all practical. Apart from the issue of a definitive source of information and keeping it up to date within the application, such a list would be so long it would be impractical for the user to try to select one from it.

So I created a cut down list of what might be termed _body groups_. I'll add new entries to the groups as appropriate, but this means people have to let me know if their body isn't covered! Raise an issue and I'll get a new body into the next build.

= Circle of Confusion =

The only piece of information relevant to the application about a body is the circle of confusion value. It should be somewhere buried in the manufacturer's specifications for the camera or the sensor it uses.

If you know that value you can create your own body in the data file _res/xml/bodies_. The format should be self explanatory.
