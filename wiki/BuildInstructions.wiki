= How to build the project =

This guide is brief. You're expected to know how to use Eclipse and its [http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html Android development environment], and to have Subversive installed and working.

In Eclipse, select:

*File -> New -> Other...*

then find:

*SVN -> Project from SVN*

in the dialog. Click Next, select:

*Create a new repository location*

and click Next again.

Add a repository of:

*http://android-depth-of-field-gpl.googlecode.com/svn/ *

with a suitable label, say *DoFC*. Click Next, then Finish.

A new dialog appears asking you how you want to check out the project. Select:

*Find projects in the children of the selected resource*

and click Finish.

At the next dialog confirm you want to:

*Check out as projects in the workspace*

and click Finish. Your new project will appear in the Eclipse project explorer.

Right click on the project title and select *Properties*, then click *Android* and make sure *Android 1.6* is selected (which is the target the project is built for).

Now click:

*Project -> Clean*

and clean the project, then allow it to rebuild.

You should now be able to run the project as an *Android Application* and it'll launch in a new emulator (or on your phone, if suitably connected).
