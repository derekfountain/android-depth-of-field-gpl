= v0.9beta Released =

The project is in beta, and isn't currently in the Android Marketplace. I'd like to iron any bugs out before it goes there, and perhaps get some feedback on my choice of [Bodies bodies], [Lenses lenses] and [Ranges ranges].

Instructions to pull the source into Eclipse and build it for your phone are [BuildInstructions here].
