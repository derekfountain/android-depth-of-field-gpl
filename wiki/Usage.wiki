= How to use a Depth of Field Calculator =

Some, indeed many, images require some thought about the depth of field to use for the best result. Consider this example:

Clearly the desired effect for this sort of shot is to get the subject in sharp focus, while throwing the background out into a nice blur.

This shot was taken at 200mm, which framed the subject nicely, on a Canon 20D, and with the subject about 7 metres (20ft) away. Opening the lens up to its maximum f/2.8, I can set the DoFC as shown:

The values the application shows reveal a problem. Looking at the diagram, the middle figure at the top shows the depth of field the camera will produce using those settings - 13cm, or about 5 inches. That means that if I focus on the face, there will only be about 6cm in front and behind the face that's in focus. That's not enough - the clothing and flyaway hair will be out of focus. In some portraits that might be the desired effect, but in most candid shots it tends to be distracting.

Looking at the subject, I think maybe 30cm (12 inches) is a more sensible value for this scenario. That will keep in crisp focus the whole person, clothes, hair, bag, and water bottle. But that's all I want, since any more depth of field will start to bring in the background and will distract from the subject.

So I start to slide the DoFC's aperture slider to the right, watching that depth of field value. I'm looking for a value closer to the desired depth of 30cm. I find it at f/6.4:

So that's the setting to use on the camera.

Of course, you can't use a DoFC for every shot you take, but it's good to stop and check the important ones. After a while experience tells you what will work. The photo above wasn't checked at the time of shooting, and I chose f/5.6 which felt about right. I later found that that gave a DoFC of 26cm - close enough to result in the image I was after.
